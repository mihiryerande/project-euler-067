# Problem 67:
#     Maximum Path Sum 2
#
# Description:
#     By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
#       the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
#
#            (3)
#           (7) 4
#          2 (4) 6
#         8  5 (9) 3
#
#     That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
#
#     Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click and Save Link/Target As...),
#       a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
#
#     NOTE:
#       This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18.
#       It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2^99 altogether!
#       If you could check one trillion (10^12) routes every second
#         it would take over twenty billion years to check them all.
#       There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
